Nodax
=====
An experiment. How to make a graphical programming language such as the blueprint in UE4 ?

use : 
Right click on background to see node list.
Right click on object to delete them.

warning :
The messiest code I ever wrote.
Very experimental and high chance of crash. 
Doesn't compile for html5, ugly on windows target, works better on flash.

I feel like the way I generate my node is overly complicated and that I could do
a way better use of reflection. 

goal :
Learning macros, templates, reflexion.

what's next ? :
	- react to event
	- add an object
	- add components to it
	- more node. (if , loops ect)
	- manipulate those components with the graph
	- save / load
	- generate haxe code of a graph and compile it
